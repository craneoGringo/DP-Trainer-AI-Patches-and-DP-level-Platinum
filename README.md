# DP-Trainer-AI-Patches-and-DP-level-Platinum
A repository with the original BPS patches for the following ROM hacks:

* Pokemon Diamond Version Trainer AI Patch

* Pokemon Diamond Version Trainer AI Patch Plus

* Pokemon Pearl Version Trainer AI Patch

* Pokemon Pearl Version Trainer AI Patch Plus

* Pokemon DP-level Platinum

* Pokemon DP-level Platinum Plus

# Features

These patches were originally made to fix the Trainer AI bug found in the original Diamond and Pearl games, but got expanded to making slightly more challenging versions of Diamond, Pearl and Platinum based on ideas I had since a long time ago without changing much about the games themselves.

The base patches for DP only change the Trainer AI behavior of all NPC trainers to be the same as Platinum's Trainer AI, while the Plus versions add an extra Pokemon from Platinum to each Elite Four member.

The base patch for Pl increases the Pokemon levels of the Rival, Elite Four and Champion to those found in DP when you battle them for the first time, while the Plus version also adds a Pokemon from DP to the Elite Four (both first time and rematch battle) and Champion (rematch battle). One other outside the League also has a modified Pokemon as an Easter Egg.
